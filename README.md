TETRIS game made in C++ with Raylib library
---

# IMPORTANT ! : use "git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:Pococo19/tetris_exoxtik.git" when cloning to get the submodule lib

Then run "script.sh" and wait the instructions :))

(this project was used as demonstration of students work on a Epitech JPO)

This project was carried out during the Octoberâ€“November 2025 period, as part of my second-year internship.
I decided to learn C++ on my own, along with object-oriented programming, and to create a proper TETRIS game that could be useful for an Arcade Project or demonstration.
