## 🚀 Objective

This project was an opportunity to learn **C++** on my own and dive into **object-oriented programming**.  
The goal was to build a clean and functional **TETRIS clone**, suitable for an Arcade project or as a technical demonstration.

## 📦 Installation

### Clone the project (with submodules)

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:Pococo19/tetris_exoxtik.git
```

> ⚠️ The `--recurse-submodules` option is required to fetch the library included as a submodule.

### Run the setup script

```bash
./script.sh
```

> Follow the instructions shown in the terminal.
